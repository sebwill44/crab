## Guide

### Install

Everything should work if Rust is installed. Run `cargo install cargo-run-script` to get the script manager. Then, run `cargo run-script dev_run` to clean and run the project.

### Wav Files

Allow for storage of directly sampled analog sounds without further processing. .WAV is a wrapper for PCM encoding, which is raw uncompressed digital audio data. See <http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/>
